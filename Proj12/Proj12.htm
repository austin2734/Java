<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the Orientation link in your Blackboard course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and&nbsp;make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your assignment.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this assignment. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the assignment. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code and Class Files</h2>

<p>You will find the following files in the same zip file from which you 
extracted this project specification.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Proj12.java</li>
	<li>Proj12Skeleton.txt</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike previous assignments, you will not find compiled class files for my 
version of the program in the zip file.</p>

<center>
<h2>Java Version Requirement</h2>
</center>

<p>Software version requirements are specified in the syllabus for this course.</p>

<div class="a"><p>Proj12 Copyright 2021R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, the purpose of this assignment is to assess your
ability to write a program dealing with the <em>this</em> and
<em>super</em> keywords.</p>
	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Begin with the files that you downloaded named <strong>Proj12.java</strong> 
		and <strong>Proj12Skeleton.txt</strong>.
		</p>
	<p>Rename the text file from <strong>Proj12Skeleton.txt</strong> to
	<strong>Proj12Runner.java</strong>. At that point the program will compile 
	and run but it will not meet the specifications given below.</p>
	<p>You must update the file named <strong>Proj12Runner.java</strong> to 
	cause the program to meet the specifications by:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Inserting your name where indicated.</li>
		<li>Modifying only one other physical line of code.</li>
	</ol>
	  <p>Note that you must not modify code in the file named <strong>Proj12.java</strong>.</p>
	<p>When you place both files in the same folder, compile them both, and run 
	the file named <strong>Proj12.java</strong>, the program must display the 
	text shown below on the command line screen.</p>
	<p>The numeric output values are based on a random number generator and will 
	differ from one run to the next unless you enter a command-line argument. If 
	you would like to get the same random value from one run to the next for 
	testing purposes, enter a command-line argument such as 5.</p>

<pre>
Random byte value = -65
My name is
Replace this String with your name
and I certify that this program is my own work
and is not the work of others. I agree not
to share my solution with others.
-65
Reminder
Student must rename Proj12Skeleton.txt to
Proj12Runner.java.
Then student must update Proj12Runner.java by:
1. Inserting his or her name where indicated.
2. Modifying ONLY ONE other physical line of code.
DO NOT add any new lines of code.
